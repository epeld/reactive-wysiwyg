Random thoughts:
------------------------

- Protobuff, sort files before "compiling"

- Generate e.g java-code from the definitions	

---

- We could really use some string interpolation macro for parenscript!

- Generate CSS to string

- Consider supporting ajax or other means of running actions

- Revisit the editor / JSON schema idea

- "deploy" functions as GET/POST endpoints, i.e
stateless responses to queries

- Figure out a working "page concept" i.e how to move between pages
and how to treat each page individually


- Make a graph out of "links between pages"



---------------

Smaller tasks:

-  consider detecting all event handlers and generating automatic selenium tests for them

----------------------------
long-term goal:

figure out a good data manipulation language that can be compiled to e.g lisp, JS, erlang
then look into automatically generating servers in erlang for running the backend sessions
and producing JS code for the frontend

can we interface SBCL and erlang using FFI?
