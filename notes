Random thoughts:
------------------------

- We could really use some string interpolation macro for parenscript!

- Maybe we should limit us to a subset of PS that we can typecheck?

- Generate CSS to string

- Client-local state (temporary state!)

- Higher level components


---------------

Smaller tasks:

- Make a JS endpoint for downloading the library JS code
- Decrease inline JS to a minimum per view/page
- Make use of the new "component object structure" (see :virtual-dom)
- Make websocket connectivity code take a virtual-dom module (or similar) as argument
