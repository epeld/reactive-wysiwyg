Random thoughts:
------------------------
 
A good next step is to support RMI calls in generated PS.
I.e define a PS macro (rmi my-action arg1) that automatically
inserts a stub in the PS that sends a message serverside


Also figure out how we can reference various resources easily in the GUI,
i.e how we can dynamically figure out their URLs from, say a uuid.

Do we need to replicate the same function in PS and lisp for generating
the URLs?
