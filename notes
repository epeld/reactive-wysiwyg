Random thoughts:
------------------------


We want styling that looks like:
(rule (selector (class "emphasis"))
      (selector (class "other"))
      (style
            (:font-weight :bold)
	    (:font-size" 1.5 (:unit "em"))))

which would compile down to
.emphasis, .other {
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 1.5em;
}

----------------

we want HTML/hyperscript that looks like:
(:div (:class "emphasis") "This will be bold"
      	      		  (:p "child element")
      	      		  (:p (:width "100px") "This is a child element"))

That is, no distinction between args and children. 
When converting back to attrs, use knowledge of existing attr names to
figure out what is what
