Random thoughts:
------------------------
 
ACTION LOG:


server maintains a log of all actions. for every nth action it consolidates the state into a "snapshot" to improve performance

for general usage we just need a "latest" snapshot really

-------------------------

make new endpoints!
we want to allow viewing open sessions as well as modifying the data live
