QUICK ROADMAP:

We want to be able to:
- style components individually

- publish components

- inspect component data, e.g by providing links in debug mode

- edit/update component data using e.g http POST

- trigger actions from the server

- open up an action timeline (maintain log of all performed actions + initial state!)

- trigger actions from a menu? in debug mode (not THAT important I guess..)

- devise a schema for where data ends up e.g where do we store the action log?
transitive state? etc
  
---------------------------
IMPROVEMENT:

- Identify ALL resources using a uuid (including state, component, actions etc).
This allows to edit e.g state on different pages as well as cross referencing
and all sorts of stuff..

---------------------------
DATA STRUCTURE:

- Seems like we are moving towards a layered approach to state:
we have e.g application state (data) but we also have appliation meta data
such as:
- Debug mode yes/no
- uuid of state object?
- Action timeline + initial state + current 'time position' wrt time line


-----------------------
IMPROVEMENT:

in the long run we probably also want to move away from alists and towards classes


----------------

ACTION LOG:


if server connection is maintained, then a timeline can be just another component
rendered in an iframe, whose data is the action log of the 'real' component
