We want to be able to define components:

(defcomponent mycomp ()
	      (:mypsx goes here)
	      (list "This is some initial state")
	      (css "This is optional styling"))


Components are automatically exposed through URLs for easy testing.
Components can refer to eachother:

> (subcomponent sub-state)

which will actually `include` the whole subcomponent in the resulting hyperscript
