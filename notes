Websocket needs to return a WS-resource per URL-request.
Needs to return the same resource on consequent requests to same URL
 but the resources should be created on-the-fly (and torn down when unused)
 
1. On incoming request, search through list of open sessions, return one matching if found
   
2. If no one matching, return new resource that is added (add-session or whatever)
   
3. Each open session should support updating its state and notifying listeners
   which requires a signal-instance where the open WS-client is a listener!
   
4. Each open session can receive messages using a protocol. E.g either "get" or "set"
   in the basic implementation. "set" notifies listeners. "get" returns current state
   (use JSON!)
   
5. Build two HTML-clients; one which pretty prints JSON state and displays it. One
   which tries to render using virtual DOM!

6. Make sure sessions are pinged and destroyed on client disconnect!
