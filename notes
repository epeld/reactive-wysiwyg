Notes on how to proceed with this project:

----------------------

Write a :web-components module and a :signals module where we can do e.g

(defcomponent "mycomponent"
	      (:myhtml bla bla))
	      
(defsignal "mysignal" 3)
	   
----------------------

then write a hunchentoot dispatcher that can display e.g a signal and provide editing facilities

similarly, provide a way to view the component as well as edit it from a browser. Consider using
e.g query params or POST params for supplying (param xxx) values
    
----------------------

Provide "list"-views, where users can see all their components and all their signals together

-----------------------

Extend HTML compiler with simple logic. Consider just supporting all of CL (or parenscript) initially!

-----------------------

Provide "compile to React" functionality

Port signal-concept to parenscript. Link ps-signals to cl-signals using a websocket

-----------------------

Rewrite the whole fronted using the above functionality (plugging it into "meta signals" etc)
