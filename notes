Random thoughts:
------------------------
 
ACTION LOG:


server maintains a log of all actions. for every nth action it consolidates the state into a "snapshot" to improve performance

for general usage we just need a "latest" snapshot really

-------------------------

make new endpoints!
we want to allow viewing open sessions as well as modifying the data live



-----------------------------

We want different kinds of sessions, e.g stateful sessions, meta sessions etc

a session should be able to:
- handle a given set of actions
- return its current state as a plist

if we create a stateful session, we can then specialize its generic action handling method
for doing what we want. This also creates a nice way of separating example actions into
a stateful-example-session so that they don't pollute the rest of the code

TODO figure out how we want the 'stateful' class to behave. this is the basis
for our standard ws sessions
