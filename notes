Random thoughts:
------------------------

- We could really use some string interpolation macro for parenscript!

- Maybe we should limit us to a subset of PS that we can typecheck?

- Generate CSS to string

- Client-local state (temporary state!)

- Higher level components

- Consider supporting ajax or other means of running actions

- Revisit the editor / JSON schema idea

- Revive the html-parse module

- "deploy" functions as GET/POST endpoints, i.e
stateless responses to queries

- Figure out a working "page concept" i.e how to move between pages
and how to treat each page individually


- Make a graph out of "links between pages"

----------------------------
long-term goal:

figure out a good data manipulation language that can be compiled to e.g lisp, JS, erlang
then look into automatically generating servers in erlang for running the backend sessions
and producing JS code for the frontend

can we interface SBCL and erlang using FFI?


---------------

Smaller tasks:

- Do we need to depend on a global send-message function for actions to work?

1. once this is done, make the final steps for introducing temporary state
2. then move on to creating some higher level components (eg input fields etc) making use of them
3. consider detecting all event handlers and generating automatic selenium tests for them
4. keep churning out higher level components!
