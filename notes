Random thoughts:
------------------------
 
A good next step is to support RMI calls in generated PS.
I.e define a PS macro (rmi my-action arg1) that automatically
inserts a stub in the PS that sends a message serverside


-----------------

how do we:

- Connect a view with a stateful (session)?
- Translate action strings back into symbols to execute on the stateful?
- Allow multiple views on the same session?

Must we allow being able to add new views dynamically? No. The statefuls can
set themselves up when created. The user can then just 'deploy' the available
views to different urls, e.g (when (requestedp "/main") (render main-view)) etc.

One use case we want to support is a user developing a GUI interactively, defining
some hyperscript, then refershing his browser to see how it looks.
This can be done by implementing a new subclass of app-state, e.g 'app-prototype'
with one defvared view or e.g just a defmethod that keeps getting reevaluated
when the user edits the hyperscript.

- Should sessions be able to list all their views? Or all their URLs? Would this
help in any way? It might help to know which clients are connected to which URLs
currently.

STOP TREATING SESSIONS WITH A ONE SIZE FITS ALL FRAMEWORK. Just develop tools for
quick development. It IS useful to be able to inspect a session's state using
a URL, sort of a debugging view. But each session must itself decide what to
render there, effectively choosing how to display its state.

I think we are being too generic in how actions are treated. Should each session
not just decide for itself what it means to run an action?
